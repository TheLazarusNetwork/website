        <p class="text-justify">Social distancing is one of the key ways of limiting the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which is leading to more and more organisations asking staff to work from home. However, the rush to remote working can create additional cybersecurity threats. Think very carefully before clicking on a tempting link purporting to be from the World Health Organization (WHO), or similar, with positive information about the cure for COVID-19. Chances are it’ll be a hacker preying on your understandable anxiety about the coronavirus pandemic.
