                <h4 class="title">Lazarus Inc | Terms of Service </h4>
                <p>Thanks for using Lazarus Inc! These terms of service (“​Terms​”) cover your use and access to our
                    services, client software and websites ("​Services​"). If you reside outside of Canada your
                    agreement is with Lazarus Inc Company. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your
                    information while our Acceptable Use Policy outlines your responsibilities when using our Services.
                    By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and
                    Acceptable Use Policy. If you’re using our Services for an organization, you’re agreeing to these
                    Terms on behalf of that organization.
                </p>

                <h4 class="title">Your Stuff & Your Permissions </h4>
                <p>When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts,
                    and so on (“​Your Stuff​”). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms won't give us any rights to Your Stuff
                    except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
                </p>
                <p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you
                    ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like photo thumbnails, document previews,
                    commenting, easy sorting, editing, sharing, and searching. These and other features may require our
                    systems to access, store, and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this
                    permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our Acceptable Use Policy.
                    With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren’t responsible for the content people post
                    and share via the Services.

                <h4 class="title">Software </h4>
                <p>Some of our Services allow you to download client software (“​Software​”) which may update
                    automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, non
                    transferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent
                    any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we’ll make that license
                    available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms.
                    Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or
                    decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.

                <h4 class="title">Beta Services </h4>
                <p>We sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. Those Services
                    have been marked beta, preview, early access, or evaluation (or with words or phrases with similar
                    meanings) and may not be as reliable as Lazarus Inc’s other services, so please keep that in mind.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="title">Our Stuff </h4>
                <p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don’t
                    grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, others’ content in the Services, Lazarus
                    Inc trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use

                <h4 class="title">Copyright </h4>
                <p>We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of
                    alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported
                    using our Copyright Policy. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be
                    infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers. Our designated channel for notice of alleged
                    copyright infringement on the Services is:

                <h4 class="title">Termination </h4>
                <p>You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your
                    access to the Services with notice to you if: </p>
                <ol class="list-unstyled">

                </ol>
                <p>We’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account
                    to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your
                    Stuff from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we’ll
                    terminate or suspend your access to the Services.
                </p>

                <h4 class="title">Discontinuation of Services </h4>
                <p>We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond Lazarus
                    Inc’s control or to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we’ll give you reasonable prior
                    notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems. If we discontinue Services in this way
                    before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we’ll refund the portion of the
                    fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h4 class="title">Services “AS IS” </h4>
                <p>We strive to provide great services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. To the fullest extent permitted by law, lazarus inc and its affiliates, suppliers and distributors make no warranties, either express or implied, about the services. The services are provided "As is." we also disclaim any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Some places don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="title">Limitation of Liability Discontinuation of Services </h4>
                <p>We don’t exclude or limit our liability to you where it would be illegal to do so—this includes any liability for Lazarus's or its affiliates’ fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation in providing the services. In countries where the following types of exclusions aren’t allowed, we're responsible to you only for losses and damages that are a reasonably foreseeable result of our failure to use reasonable care and skill or our breach of our contract with you. This paragraph doesn’t affect consumer rights that can't be waived or limited by any contract or agreement.
                </p>
                <p>In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, Lazarus inc, its affiliates, suppliers or distributors won’t be liable for: </p>
                <ol class="list-unstyled">

                    <li>
                        <strong>(a) </strong> any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages, or
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>(b) </strong> any loss of use, data, business, or profits, regardless of legal theory.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>(c) </strong> you don’t have a paid account and haven't accessed our services for 12 consecutive months.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>These exclusions or limitations will apply regardless of whether or not Lazarus or any of its affiliates has been warned of the possibility of such damages.
                </p>
                <p>If you use the services for any commercial, business, or re-sale purpose, Lazarus, its affiliates, suppliers, or distributors will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity. Lazarus and its affiliates aren’t responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any user of the services.
                </p>
                <p>In countries where exclusions or limitations of liability are allowed, Lazarus inc, its affiliates, suppliers or distributors won’t be liable for: other than for the types of liability we cannot limit by law (as described in this section), we limit our liability to you to the greater of $20 USD or 100% of any amount you've paid under your current service plan with Lazarus.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="title">Controlling Law </h4>
                <p>These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However,
                    some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be
                    governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="title">Entire Agreement </h4>
                <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Lazarus Inc with respect to the subject
                    matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or
                    terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third
                    party beneficiary rights.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="title">Waiver, Severability & Assignment </h4>
                <p>Lazarus Inc’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a
                    provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect
                    and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may
                    not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Lazarus Inc may
                    assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any
                    business associated with the Services.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="title">Modifications </h4>
                <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:
                </p>
                <ol class="list-unstyled">

                    <li>
                        <strong>(a) </strong> changes to the law,

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>(c) </strong> improvements or enhancements made to our Services.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we’ll
                    notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated
                    with your account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less
                    than 30 days from when we notify you.
                </p>
                <p>If you don’t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective.
                    Where applicable, we’ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for
                    Services and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the
                    updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
