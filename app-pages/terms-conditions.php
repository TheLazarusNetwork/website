                <p>Thanks for using Lazarus Inc! These terms of service (“​Terms​”) cover your use and access to our
                    services, client software and websites ("​Services​"). If you reside outside of Canada your
                    agreement is with Lazarus Inc Company. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your
                    information while our Acceptable Use Policy outlines your responsibilities when using our Services.
                    By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and
                    Acceptable Use Policy. If you’re using our Services for an organization, you’re agreeing to these
                    Terms on behalf of that organization.

                <h4 class="title">Your Stuff & Your Permissions </h4>
                <p>When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts,
                    and so on (“​Your Stuff​”). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms won't give us any rights to Your Stuff
                    except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
                </p>
                <p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you
                    ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like photo thumbnails, document previews,
                    commenting, easy sorting, editing, sharing, and searching. These and other features may require our
                    systems to access, store, and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this
                    permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.

                <h4 class="title">Software </h4>
                <p>Some of our Services allow you to download client software (“​Software​”) which may update

                    available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms.
                    Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or

                <p>We sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. Those Services
                    have been marked beta, preview, early access, or evaluation (or with words or phrases with similar
                    meanings) and may not be as reliable as Lazarus Inc’s other services, so please keep that in mind.

                    fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.

                <h4 class="title">Controlling Law </h4>
                <p>These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However,
                    some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be
                    governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="title">Entire Agreement </h4>
                <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Lazarus Inc with respect to the subject
                    matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or
                    terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third
                    party beneficiary rights.

            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="title">Waiver, Severability & Assignment </h4>
                <p>Lazarus Inc’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a
                    provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect
                    and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may
                    not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Lazarus Inc may
                    assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any
                    business associated with the Services.

                    updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
